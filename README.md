# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Initial analysis
We did an analysis on Louise fundraising campaign, we used the data from her previous and live campaigns. She sent us the data 
The questions we want to answer are? 

*When will the be the best time to launch a fundraising in theater campaign in the US?
*What is the average donation by parent company? 
*Should she launch a project in Great Britain with an estimated budget of $ 4000.-?

Here are our findings:

*We have found that May to June is the best time to launch a theater campaign in the US.

*We have found that out of the parent category the “plays” category is the most successful.

*She could launch a project in Great Britain with an estimated bduget of $ 4000.- but she should try to get her play produce for less, although the mean campaign goal is around £4,000 but half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.

### Challenge
Based on our research and using the data provided to us by Louise, it is hard to find an exact correlation between the campaign initial goal and the success of the campaign for plays. 

Outcome based on goals, what the graph below demonstrate is that:
*Up to a $29 999.- goal, her chances of her successful campaign decrease the higher the goal is. 
*If the goal is $ 29 999.- or higher, there is no clear correlation between campaign initial goal and the success of the campaign.

Outcome based on launch date
*The second finding from our research and shown in the graph below is that the best time of the year to launch a campaign for theater is between April and June, the best month is May. Hence based on our finding, the best time to launch a campaign for plays will be in May and in order to increase its chance of success Louise should aim at a $ 29 999.- or below goal.

*Also based on the graphic below the length of the campaign does affect so much its success either. We should also look at the length successful campaign run between 19 to 39 days. Unsuccessful campaign run between 20 to 34 day.

Limitations:

*Our study is limited by the fact that it is only based on one set of data. 
*We are also not comparing the same thing, although plays fall under the theater category, the trend can be affected by the other subcategories in theater. 
*We are only using two factors, launch date and goals, we should also link the goal to the two factors.
