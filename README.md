# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Initial analysis
We did an analysis on Louise fundraising campaign, we used the data from her previous and live campaigns. She sent us the data 
The questions we want to answer are? 

*When will the be the best time to launch a fundraising in theater campaign in the US?
*What is the average donation by parent company? 
*Should she launch a project in Great Britain with an estimated budget of $ 4000.-?

Here are our findings:

*We have found that May to June is the best time to launch a theater campaign in the US.

*We have found that out of the parent category the “plays” category is the most successful.

*She could launch a project in Great Britain with an estimated bduget of $ 4000.- but she should try to get her play produce for less, although the mean campaign goal is around £4,000 but half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
